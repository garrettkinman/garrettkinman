### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Garrett, a recent graduate in computer engineering.

### What I'm interested in
<!-- talk about interests, particularly technical -->
* Sustainability
* Embedded ML
* Reinforcement learning and intelligent control
* Computer vision (including depth vision)
* RISC-V
* Interesting new tools/languages (e.g., Julia, Rust, WebAssembly...)
* Systems-level thinking

### What I'm currently working on
<!-- talk about current projects, studies, goals -->
* MSc in Electrical Engineering (embedded CNN applications on low-power RISC-V ML processor)
* Cool Climate data science project (using Julia)

### Where I'm headed next
<!-- talk about upcoming job, grad school, projects, studies, long-term... -->
* One day, hopefully using embedded ML and intelligent control as part of a climate solution
