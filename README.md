### What I'm interested in
<!-- talk about interests, particularly technical -->
* Sustainability
* Embedded ML
* RISC-V
* New languages (e.g., Julia, Nim)

### What I've done previously
* BEng in computer engineering
* MSc in electrical engineering
* Deep learning & computer vision w/ PyTorch, Flux.jl
* RL-based packet scheduling for low-cost water level sensors for Arctic IoT

### What I'm currently working on
<!-- talk about current projects, studies, goals -->
* Embedded ML research engineer
* Genetic algorithm-based optimizer for neural networks using Flux.jl
* Embedded Nim using Ratel

### Where I'm headed next
<!-- talk about upcoming job, grad school, projects, studies, long-term... -->
* TinyML inference library with Nim
* (Hopefully) Tiny Spiking Neural Networks (TinySNNs, if you will)
