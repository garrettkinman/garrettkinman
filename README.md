### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Garrett, a graduating computer engineering student (BEng) at McGill University, <!-- TODO: finish tagline -->

### What I'm interested in
<!-- talk about interests, particularly technical -->
* Sustainability
* Embedded ML
* Reinforcement learning and intelligent control
* Domain-specific architectures
* RISC-V
* Interesting new tools/languages (e.g., Julia, Rust, WebAssembly...)

### What I'm currently working on
<!-- talk about current projects, studies, goals -->
* Finishing up my undergrad (trying to learn as much about embedded systems and AI as possible!)
* Centralized, intelligent coordination of multiple robots (using RL, via Bluetooth)
* AI agent to play Pentago-Twist
* Pipelined MIPS processor
* Courses:
  * AI
  * Embedded Systems
  * Linear Systems & Control
  * Computer Architecture

### How I got here
<!-- talk about past experiences, internships, courses -->
* Summer 2019:
  * First internship @ Humanitas Solutions â€” Developed a cross-platform app to communicate with drone-based ad-hoc network over TCP and UDP
  * Tried (and failed) at self-learning ML using Andrew Ng's famous online ML course
* Fall 2019:
  * Finally learned a bit of ML with MAIS' ML Bootcamp
* Winter 2020:
  * COVID â€” Finally had to learn how to learn online
* Summer 2020:
  * Second internship @ CloudOps â€” Did full-stack development to add Kubernetes-related features to CloudOps' cloud services interface
  * Promptly realized I did not want to spend the rest of my life doing full-stack software development
  * Decided I wanted to go into intelligent control and/or embedded ML
  * Tried (and succeeded!) at self-learning digital signal processing using EPFL's online DSP course
  * Helped develop phase-locked loop simulations for JPL
  * Learned of Julia, learned Julia, started proselytizing Julia
* Fall 2020:
  * Built a parallelized version of max pooling using experimental WebAssembly features
  * Created a gyro-controlled ascii-graphics game on a microprocessor
  * Made a person detector to detect people in video a video feed

### Where I'm headed next
<!-- talk about upcoming job, grad school, projects, studies, long-term... -->
* Third internship @ Analog Devices â€” Embedded software for autonomous vehicles/robots
* MSc in Electrical Engineering @ McGill University â€” Embedded CNN applications on low-power RISC-V ML accelerator
* Probably a lot more online courses, tbh
* One day, hopefully using embedded ML and intelligent control as part of a climate solution
