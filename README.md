### Hi there

I'm a grad student in embedded systems and machine learning.

### What I'm interested in
<!-- talk about interests, particularly technical -->
* Sustainability
* Embedded ML
* Reinforcement learning
* Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT)
* RISC-V
* New languages (e.g., Julia, Nim)

### What I've done previously
* BEng in computer engineering
* Deep learning & computer vision w/ PyTorch, Flux.jl
* LoRa messenger w/ ESP32

### What I'm currently working on
<!-- talk about current projects, studies, goals -->
* MSc in electrical engineering
* RL-based packet scheduling for low-cost water level sensors for Arctic IoT
* Genetic algorithm-based optimizer for neural networks using Flux.jl
* Embedded Nim using Ratel

### Where I'm headed next
<!-- talk about upcoming job, grad school, projects, studies, long-term... -->
* One day, hopefully using embedded systems and ML for sustainability
